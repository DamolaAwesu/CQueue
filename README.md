# CQueue
simple C implementation of queue as an abstract data type (ADT).
Features:
- Programmable queue depth
- Queue can be statically or dynamically allocated
- Element insert (push)
- Element removal (pop)
- Queue track flags: count, head, tail

TODO: fix issue with queuePop(Queue* q, int* top) in static allocation mode. Issue - value written to top is wrong
NTH: add more in-built methods to Queue ADT e.g sort, insertAtIndex, removeFromIndex
